# Something need to install 
on Ubuntu 1804

I will install
* tmux
* oh-my-zsh
* vim-gnome
* docker
* docker-compose

make sure you have `wget`

```
git clone https://github.com/linnil1/MyDotFiles
cd MyDotFiles
```

and run **`sh run.sh`**

then logout and login again and you can see the result

## Reference
`.gitconifg` is from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1057564/pretty-git-branch-graphs
`.tmux.conf` is `screen` flavor
